# ViewManager Error - Complete Fix Guide

## The Problem
The ViewManager error you're seeing is caused by React Native's autolinking system failing to properly register native components. This is a common issue with complex projects that have many native dependencies.

## Root Causes:
1. Conflicting native dependency versions
2. Incorrect autolinking configuration
3. Corrupted build cache
4. React Native 0.80.2 compatibility issues with newer dependencies

## Complete Solution:

### Option 1: Automated Fix (Recommended)
1. Run the updated `clean-and-rebuild.bat` script I created
2. Wait for it to complete (may take 5-10 minutes)
3. After completion, run: `npx react-native run-android`

### Option 2: Manual Steps
If the automated script doesn't work, follow these manual steps:

#### Step 1: Complete Environment Cleanup
```bash
# Stop all processes
taskkill /f /im node.exe
taskkill /f /im yarn.exe

# Clean caches
npx react-native start --reset-cache
# Stop it after a few seconds (Ctrl+C)

# Clean Android
cd android
gradlew clean
cd ..

# Clean npm
npm cache clean --force
```

#### Step 2: Remove and Reinstall
```bash
# Remove node_modules completely
rmdir /s /q node_modules
del package-lock.json

# Reinstall with legacy peer deps to avoid conflicts
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

#### Step 3: Fix Native Dependencies
```bash
# Clear autolinking cache
rmdir /s /q "android\app\build\generated\autolinking"

# Create fonts directory
mkdir "android\app\src\main\assets\fonts"

# Copy vector icon fonts
for %f in (node_modules\react-native-vector-icons\Fonts\*) do copy "%f" "android\app\src\main\assets\fonts\"
```

#### Step 4: Build
```bash
# Start Metro (in one terminal)
npx react-native start

# Build and run (in another terminal)  
npx react-native run-android
```

## Files I've Fixed:

### 1. `react-native.config.js`
- Configured proper autolinking for native dependencies
- Disabled problematic autolinking for vector icons
- Added font asset linking

### 2. `MainApplication.kt`
- Simplified package registration
- Removed manual imports that were causing conflicts
- Used proper PackageList autolinking

### 3. `android/app/build.gradle`
- Added dependency resolution strategies
- Forced compatible Android library versions
- Prevented React Native version conflicts

### 4. `clean-and-rebuild.bat`
- Comprehensive cleanup script
- Handles all cache clearing
- Reinstalls dependencies properly
- Sets up fonts correctly

## Expected Results:
After following these steps, you should see:
- No more red ViewManager error screen
- App loads normally with all components working
- Vector icons display properly

## If Issues Persist:

### Check These:
1. Android SDK is up to date
2. Java version is correct (11 or 17)
3. Android emulator/device is running
4. No antivirus blocking file operations

### Additional Debugging:
```bash
# Check React Native environment
npx react-native doctor

# Check Android environment
npx react-native run-android --verbose

# Check specific dependency
npx react-native info
```

## Alternative Package.json:
If you continue having issues, I've created `package-fixed.json` with more compatible dependency versions. You can:
1. Backup your current `package.json`
2. Replace it with `package-fixed.json` 
3. Run the cleanup script again

This should resolve the ViewManager error completely. The key is ensuring all native dependencies are properly linked and there are no version conflicts.
